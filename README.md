# 🧠 Next Word Prediction Model using Python (LSTM)

This project implements a **Next Word Prediction** model using Python and TensorFlow/Keras. It is based on the tutorial from [AmanXAI](https://amanxai.com/2023/07/17/next-word-prediction-model-using-python/), where a language model is trained to predict the next word in a sentence using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks.

## 🚀 Features

- Word-level tokenization and sequence generation
- LSTM-based language model using Keras
- Custom sentence generation using seed text
- Adjustable temperature sampling for creative output

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional for plots)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
````

## 📚 How to Use

1. **Add your corpus**


2. **Train the model**


   This will:

   * Read and clean the text
   * Tokenize and create input sequences
   * Train an LSTM model
   * Save the trained model and tokenizer

3. **Predict next words**

   After training, enter a custom seed phrase and generate new words:

## 🧠 Sample Output

**Input:** `life is`
**Generated:** `life is a journey that leads to success`
